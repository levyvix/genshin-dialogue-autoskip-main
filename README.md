## üéÆ Overview

An automated dialogue skipper for Genshin Impact that intelligently detects and advances through story dialogue. This version uses keyboard and mouse control to simulate the F key press, automatically selecting the bottom dialogue option when choices appear.

The script includes human-like behavior patterns with randomized timing and occasional breaks to appear more natural.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automatic Dialogue Detection**: Uses pixel detection to identify when dialogue is active
- **Smart Option Selection**: Automatically chooses the bottom dialogue option
- **Multi-Resolution Support**: Auto-detects and adapts to your screen resolution (HD to 4K+)
- **Human-like Behavior**:
  - Randomized key press intervals (0.12-0.2 seconds)
  - Occasional breaks (3-8 seconds) for natural behavior
  - Intelligent timing variations
- **Easy Controls**: Simple F-key controls for starting, pausing, and stopping
- **Safe Operation**: Only activates when Genshin Impact is the active window
- **Loading Screen Detection**: Prevents actions during loading screens
- **One-Click Setup**: Automated installation script with dependency management

## üì¶ Requirements

### System Requirements
- **OS**: Windows (with win32api support)
- **Python**: 3.11 or higher
- **Display**: Primary monitor (multi-monitor setups should have game on primary display)
- **Privileges**: Administrator rights (required for key emulation)

### Software Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager (auto-installed by run.bat)
- Genshin Impact installed and running

### In-Game Settings
**IMPORTANT**: Navigate to **Settings > Other** and set **Auto-Play Story** to **Off**

## üöÄ Installation

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

1. **Download** this repository or clone it:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/1hubert/genshin-dialogue-autoskip.git
   cd genshin-dialogue-autoskip
   ```

2. **Right-click** `run.bat` and select **"Run as administrator"**
   - The script will automatically:
     - Check for Administrator privileges
     - Verify Python installation
     - Install `uv` package manager if needed
     - Install all dependencies
     - Launch the application

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Install Python 3.11+** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - ‚úÖ Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

2. **Install uv** package manager:
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

4. **Run the script** with Admin privileges:
   ```bash
   uv run autoskip_dialogue.py
   ```

## üìñ Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Launch Genshin Impact** and ensure it's running on your primary display

2. **Run the script**:
   - Right-click `run.bat` ‚Üí **"Run as administrator"**, or
   - Run `autoskip_dialogue.py` with admin privileges

3. **Verify Resolution**:
   - On first run, the script will auto-detect your screen resolution
   - Confirm the displayed resolution is correct
   - Resolution is saved to `.env` for future runs

4. **Start Auto-Skip**:
   - Press **F8** to activate auto-skip
   - The script will now automatically advance dialogue when detected

5. **Play the Game**:
   - Continue playing normally
   - Dialogue will be automatically skipped when Genshin Impact is the active window

### Controls

| Key | Action | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| **F8** | Start | Activates auto-skip functionality |
| **F9** | Pause | Temporarily pauses auto-skip |
| **F12** | Exit | Closes the application |

### Status Indicators

The console will display the current status:
- **RUNNING**: Auto-skip is active
- **PAUSED**: Auto-skip is temporarily disabled
- **Taking a break**: Simulating natural pause (3-8 seconds)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

The script creates a `.env` file to store configuration:

```env
WIDTH=1920
HEIGHT=1080
```

- **WIDTH**: Screen width in pixels (auto-detected)
- **HEIGHT**: Screen height in pixels (auto-detected)

You can manually edit `.env` if the auto-detection is incorrect.

### Supported Resolutions

The script automatically adapts to various resolutions including:
- **1920x1080** (Full HD)
- **2560x1440** (2K)
- **3840x2160** (4K)
- Custom resolutions and ultrawide monitors

## üîß How It Works

### Detection System

The script uses pixel-based detection to identify dialogue states:

1. **Autoplay Button Detection**: Monitors a specific pixel for the characteristic color of the autoplay indicator
2. **Dialogue Option Detection**: Checks for the white speech bubble indicator in dialogue options
3. **Loading Screen Protection**: Verifies the game isn't loading before taking action

### Behavior Patterns

To mimic human interaction:

- **Randomized Timing**: Each F key press has a variable interval (0.12-0.2 seconds)
- **Occasional Breaks**: 4% chance every 30 seconds to take a 3-8 second break
- **Window Checking**: Only acts when Genshin Impact is the active window

### Safety Features

- **Admin Check**: Verifies administrator privileges before running
- **Python Check**: Confirms Python installation and version
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles errors with informative messages
- **Retry Logic**: Offers retry option if execution fails

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Script won't start
- **Solution**: Ensure you're running as Administrator
- Right-click `run.bat` ‚Üí "Run as administrator"

#### "Python is not installed" error
- **Solution**: Install Python 3.11+ from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

#### Dialogue not being skipped
- **Verify**:
  - Genshin Impact is the active window
  - Auto-skip is enabled (press F8)
  - In-game "Auto-Play Story" is set to **Off**
  - Game is running on primary monitor

#### Wrong resolution detected
- **Solution**: Manually edit `.env` file with correct dimensions:
  ```env
  WIDTH=your_width
  HEIGHT=your_height
  ```

#### Key presses not working
- **Check**:
  - Script is running with Administrator privileges
  - No other programs are intercepting keyboard input
  - Genshin Impact has focus

### Error Messages

| Error | Meaning | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| "This script requires Administrator privileges" | Not running as admin | Run as administrator |
| "Python is not installed or not in PATH" | Python not found | Install Python and add to PATH |
| "Failed to install uv" | Network or permission issue | Check internet connection, try manual install |
| "Script exited with error code: X" | Runtime error | Check console for details, retry with F8 |

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the console output for error messages
2. Verify all requirements are met
3. Try running with `--verbose` flag (if available)
4. Open an issue on GitHub with:
   - Error message
   - Python version
   - Screen resolution
   - Windows version

## üéÆ Gamepad Support

This branch (`main`) is optimized for **keyboard and mouse** controls.

If you play Genshin Impact with a **gamepad/controller**, switch to the [gamepad_only](https://github.com/1hubert/genshin-dialogue-autoskip/tree/gamepad_only) branch for gamepad-optimized detection and controls.
